# Flask App Dockerized 🚀

This is a simple Flask web application containerized using Docker.  
It serves as a hands-on tryout to understand how Dockerfiles and images work.

---

## 🐳 What’s Inside?

- A basic Flask app (`app.py`)
- A `Dockerfile` to build the image
- A `requirements.txt` for dependencies

---

## 🔧 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flask-docker-tryout.git
